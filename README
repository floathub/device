device.ino
==========

Core arduino code providing floathub functionality. See floathub.com for
more information.


The mega directory contains the code flashed to the Arduino Mega.

Note that the esp8266 directory contains separate code that is to be flashed
to the onboard esp8266.

And the electron directory is used to flash the Electron board from
Particle.io (for FloatHub devices with cellular connectivity).  This code no
longer uses the Hologram Dash which was briefly used as a cellular
connectivity option.


The current and recommended build environment for this code is Arduino 1.8.9
with the following serial buffer modifications:

  HardwareSerial.h

in

  hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/HardwareSerial.h

should have the TX and RX buffers changed from 64 bytes to 256 like so:

  //#define SERIAL_TX_BUFFER_SIZE 64
  #define SERIAL_TX_BUFFER_SIZE 256
  ...
  //#define SERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE 64
  #define SERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE 256

Similarly, the Software Serial library should be modified:

  SoftwareSerial.h

in

  hardware/arduino/avr/libraries/SoftwareSerial/    

should have the RX buffer changed from 64 bytes to 128 bytes as in:

  //#define _SS_MAX_RX_BUFF 64 // RX buffer size
  #define _SS_MAX_RX_BUFF 128 // RX buffer size



ESP8266 Libraries
-----------------

The currently recommended board library version is 2.5.1. The compile time settings in the Arduino environment are:

Board:              Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266
Upload Speed:       115200
CPU Frequency:      80 MHz		
Flash Size:	    4M (3M SPIFFS)
Debug Port:         Disabled
Debug Level:        None
lwIP Variant:	    v1.4 Higher Bandwidth
VTables:	    Flash
Exceptions:         Disabled
Erase Flash:        Only Sketch
SSL Support:        All SSL ciphers (most compatible)



Electron/Particle.io Libraries
------------------------------

Built and tested with 1.0.1, which is the recommended version.
