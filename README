==========

Core arduino code providing floathub functionality. See floathub.com for
more information.


Note that the esp8266 directory contains separate code that is to be flashed
to the onboard esp8266.


The ONLY TESTED AND RECOMMENDED build environment for this code is Arduino
1.6.7 with the following serial buffer modifications:

  HardwareSerial.h

in

  hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/HardwareSerial.h

should have the TX and RX buffers changed from 64 bytes to 256 like so:

  //#define SERIAL_TX_BUFFER_SIZE 64
  #define SERIAL_TX_BUFFER_SIZE 256
  ...
  //#define SERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE 64
  #define SERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE 256

Similarly, the Software Serial library should be modified:

  SoftwareSerial.h

in

  hardware/arduino/avr/libraries/SoftwareSerial/    

should have the RX buffer changed from 64 bytes to 128 bytes as in:

  //#define _SS_MAX_RX_BUFF 64 // RX buffer size
  #define _SS_MAX_RX_BUFF 128 // RX buffer size
